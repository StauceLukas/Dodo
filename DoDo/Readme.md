#### Phase 2:
- Add scheduling capabilities to task.

#### Phase 3:
- User reminding of task schedule ending and repetition needed.

### Goals of this project
This side project should provide benefits of:
- Familiarity of cross platform development.
- Learn new technology of .NET MAUI.
- Experience in designing a system.
